The app "Songg" (working title) is a music composition app.

This makes use of tonal.js, a music theory library that, for example, allows you to automatically create chords and scales. The other major feature is that it allows you to export midi tracks. These you can drag and drop into other music editing applications into Garage Band.

To alter the song, directly manipulate the JSON of a song (for example, "Intro.json"). With Songg, the craft of the composition is in writing Manipulators to characterize that raw song data.

A player is currently included but is somewhat provisional; this version of the app is intended for musician-programmers who plan to export the Midi file for further refinement in another application. At a much later stage we might create an in-browser GUI.
